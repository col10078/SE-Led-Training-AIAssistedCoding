## Step 3: Sign in to GitHub Copilot

After your [IST request from Step 2](01-github-and-copilot.md#step-2-request-github-copilot-access) is approved, connect Copilot inside VS Code.

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to sign out of your GitHub account within VSCode and back in if you do not see the option to open the chat or it doesn't automatically open.

### Windows

1. Select the **Sign In** button at the top of the VS Code window.

## Step 4: Fork & Clone the Training GitHub Repository

1. Open up the training repo @ [SE-Led-Training-AIAssistedCoding](https://github.com/valdesrosier/SE-Led-Training-AIAssistedCoding).

2. In the top, right, select **Fork** and "Create a new fork" to create a copy of the repo in your GitHub account.

3. Select "Create Fork" to create a copy of the repo in your GitHub account. If the checkbox next to "Copy the <BRANCH_NAME>" is checked, be sure to un-check it. We want the default branch to be copied, not the branch you are currently on.

   ![The Copilot sign-in dialog with Continue with GitHub selected](assets/fork-repo2.jpg)

4. You will be taken to your forked repo. Leave this browser tab open.

5. Create a folder on your `C:` drive (for Mac users, `~/dev` is a good choice) for this project and any future development. For example, `C:\dev` (on Mac, `~/dev`).

6. Open a new Powershell window (or Terminal on macOS) and navigate to the folder you created in the previous step. For example, if you created a folder called `dev` on your `C:` drive, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   cd C:\dev

   # On macOS, use:
   # cd ~/dev
   ```

7. Back on in your browser, Click the green **Code** button and then click the copy button next to the HTTPS URL.

8. Back in your Powershell (or Terminal on macOS) window, run the following command to clone your forked repo to your local machine. Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your GitHub username.

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/SE-Led-Training-AIAssistedCoding.git
   ```

9. You should see a new folder called `SE-Led-Training-AIAssistedCoding` in your `C:\dev` (on Mac, `~/dev`) folder. You can now open this folder in VS Code.
